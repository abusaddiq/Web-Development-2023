    CHALLENGES 5 - ID Changer Use the following code
Step 1- Store the heading in a variable. For this first step, declare a variable and store the element inside it. 
        You can find the element by passing the ID of the h1 as a string to the document.getElementById() function.
        This webpage has an h1 with a placeholder name in it. In this challenge, you'll use JavaScript to replace that with your own name.
Step 2- Change it to your name. Tip: Make sure you spell your variable name correctly when you reference it the second time.  
        Now that you have the element stored in a variable, use the innerHTML property to change it to your own name (or username!). Step 3 - Push your codes to your GitHub.
