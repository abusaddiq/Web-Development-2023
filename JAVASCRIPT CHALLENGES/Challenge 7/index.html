        CHALLENGES 7 - 
                Query Modernizer Use the following code
            Step 1- This webpage displays a selection of Isaac Newton's Queries, a book from the 1700s. Back then, 
            Newton used the word 'doth' instead of 'does', because that's how English was spoken. 
            In this challenge, you'll change all instances of 'doth' to 'does'. 
            Each of them is surrounded by a <span> with a class of 'doth'.
            For the first step, use document.querySelectorAll to find only the 'doth's that are inside the list, 
            and store them in a variable.
